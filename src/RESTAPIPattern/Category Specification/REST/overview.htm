        <p>REST (Representational State Transfer) is a category of patterns which deal with the REST-ful interaction style of integration architectures. 
        A REST API describes a set of resources, and a set of operations that can be called on those resources. 
        The operations in a REST API can be called from any HTTP client, including client-side JavaScript code that is running in a web browser.
        REST interactions typically communicate using the HTTP verbs POST, GET, PUT and DELETE which are often used to symbolise Create, Retrieve, Update and Delete operations respectively.
