        <p>A REST API describes a set of resources, and a set of operations that can be called on those resources. 
        The operations in a REST API can be called from any HTTP client, including client-side JavaScript code that is running in a web browser.
		IBM Integration Bus version 10 introduced a new REST API artifact, which provides a simple way to receive JSON / HTTP and  expose a REST API.
		To create a REST API you must first define the resources and operations that are available in the new REST API.
		Those definitions can be supplied in a Swagger document. Swagger is an open specification for defining REST APIs.		
		If you don't have a Swagger document, then this pattern generates one for you, creates an IIB REST API and pre-populates the operations with Passthrough nodes.
